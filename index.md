Hi! I am Hristina Stoycheva, a junior data analyst.

For a long time I wondered what to do with my love for **Excel**, **formulas**, **functions**, **working with data** and **solving problems**.
I don't know why it took me so long to get to the profession of **data analyst**. 
But maybe it was meant to be.
In the meantime, I managed to gain experience in different fields, but the most interesting thing is that they were always related to working with data. 
It's just that the names of the professions were different.
Now I feel at home and believe that I can develop successfully in the field of data analysis.
I recently completed the Google Data Analytics course and now officially have Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate.
The first project I present here is the Google Data Analytics capstone case study.

I am always open to learning new skills. This gives me pleasure and satisfaction. 
And every new thing I learn gives me an additional perspective on everything in life.

* Fun fact:
  Unlike the common combination of an artist's soul in a mathematician's body, I am the soul of **a mathematician in an artist's body**.
  I've been involved in art for most of my life. But something has always drawn me to activities related to mathematics, analysis and order.
And that's actually why I started exploring working with Excel - for fun. And then it turned into a profession (*with different names*...).

I have more than 15 years of experience working with MS Excel, which helped me gain knowledge in using formulas and functions. 
In addition to the pleasure of working with them, in my long-term practice I also developed problem solving mindset encountering a very wide variety of obstacles and 
I have the skills to detect them faster and correct them more easily and effectively. My significant experience in design and art gives me strong detail orientation and 
visualization skills. 
I find the entire analysis process exciting - from getting to know the problem, through all the technical processing, to reading the answer in the data.

* I would note as my **main skills**:
  - All the work with spreadsheets - MS Excel and Google sheets

  - Perform SQL queries 
  - Sort and filter data using SQL queries 
  - Convert data types using SQL functions
  
  - Create data visualizations using Tableau
  - Create visuals in spreadsheets
  - Create presentations from data analysis results
  
  - Identify the data needs of users
  - Create dashboards using Tableau
  - Use design thinking to improve dashboards
  
  - Create data cleaning reports
  - Create and maintain change logs
  - Create reports in R Markdown
  
  - Clean data in spreadsheets
  - Sort and filter data in spreadsheets
  - Create pivot tables in spreadsheets
  
  - Install and use the tidyverse package in R 
  - Run scripts in RStudio
  - Create data visualizations in Rstudio
